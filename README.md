# BillBill - An extremely simple caching proxy
## Doesn't yet work...

Sits between the world and your website.  Caches pages on the way out and serves up cached copies if available.

Uses Alfred, MapleTree, async, request

Configs are simple - configure a domain name, origin, ttl and list of 'excludes' routes which mapleTree can match.
